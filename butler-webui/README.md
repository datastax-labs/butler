# Butler web UI

This module contains the frontend of the Butler service (the server being at 
[`butler-server`](../butler-server)).

That web UI is a [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) application. The rest of this README contains a few
pointers auto-generated by the [Vue Cli](https://cli.vuejs.org), but please see the
[server README](../butler-server/README.md) for more details on how the server and this UI
interacts.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

When working on the web UI, it is inconvenient to have to rebuild said web UI on every
change. Instead, you can start by running the server and then start a dev server (technically
provided by the [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/cli-service.html#using-the-binary)) by running
within the [`butler-webui`](./) directory:

```
npm run serve
```

This will run a server that serves the web UI from http://localhost:8081/ but with a live automatic
reload when any of the web UI changes (API calls to the server will be automatically proxied at
http://localhost:8080/).


### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Testing

Tests are implemented using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/) framework.

```
npm run tests
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
